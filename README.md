# Sequential-vs-Parallel-Processing-in-C
This project is made in C. Code doesn't ask for any input it first tells you number of threads your system has then It calculates the processing time took by sequential processing and then time took by Parallel Processing.
Don't mind the name of file is really bad done.c and I'm too lazy that I haven't changed the name of file.
